This is an implementation of the Next.JS tutorial. 
I did this to see what all the buzz was about. 

This is a special implementation: the commits and merge history is designed to make this super easy for me to grab code and look back at work real quickly. 

# Deviations 
I didn't deploy this to Vercel. I instead opted to use AWS for this.
